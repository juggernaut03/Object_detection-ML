Object Detection with YOLO
This repository contains code for object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that is extremely fast and accurate.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch
OpenCV
Ultralytics YOLO library
You can install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python-headless
pip install 'git+https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git'
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-yolo.git
cd object-detection-yolo
Run the object detection script:
bash
Copy code
python object_detection.py
Press q to quit the application.
Model and Classes
The model used for object detection is YOLOv5. It is a family of deep learning models that are based on YOLO architecture. YOLOv5 is known for its simplicity, speed, and accuracy.

The model can detect the following classes:

Person
Bicycle
Car
Motorbike
...
(Add more classes as needed)

Customization
You can customize the classes and model weights according to your requirements by modifying the code. Refer to the official YOLOv5 documentation for more details on customization options.
